// 1. String Basics. Create a class named StringExercise with a main method.
//
//		- For each of the following output examples, create a string variable named
// 			message that contains the desired output and print it out to the console.
//
//		- Do this with only one string variable and one print statement.

//				We don't need no education
//				We don't need no thought control

//				Check "this" out!, "s inside of "s!
//
//				In windows, the main drive is usually C:\
//
//				I can do backslashes \, double backslashes \\,
//				and the amazing triple backslash \\\!
//
				String message = "We don\'t need no education\n" +
						"We don\'t need no thought control\n\n" +
						"Check \"this\" out!, \"s inside of \"s!\n\n" +
						"In windows, the main drive is usually C:\\\n\n" +
						"I can do backslashes \\, double backslashes \\\\,\n" +
						"and the amazing triple backslash \\\\\\!";

				System.out.println(message);

//
// 2. Create a class named Bob with a main method for the following exercise.
//		Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.
//
//		- Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question. (the input ends with a question mark)
//		- He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him. (the input ends with an exclamation mark)
//		- He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything. (empty input)
//		- He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.
//
// 		Write the Java code necessary so that a user of your command line application
// 		can have a conversation with Bob.
